# Cs4347.002-Helium Library Application

## Requirements and Installation
The application has been tested with Python 3.10.7 on Windows 10, so that is the recommended setup.
You will also need a web-browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, and the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
Once you have installed Python, you can get the requirements by opening a command prompt in the project folder and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running and Operating
Run `start.bat` to start the server.
Then, copy and paste the URL it gives you into your browser (Likely http://localhost:5000)
You can also reset the database to it's initial state on server startup by opening a command prompt in the project folder and running `python main.py db-reset` instead of running `start.bat`.
